## 1. compute the scattering intensity (I(q)) from a molecular dynamics simulation

### gmx_mpi saxs -s npt3.tpr -f npt3.trr -b 0 -e 50000 -dt 2500

This command calculates the SAXS profile of the system described in npt3.tpr over the trajectory in npt3.trr. 
The analysis begins at 0 ps, ends at 50000 ps, and considers frames sampled every 2500 ps. This provides an averaged SAXS profile that balances computational efficiency and resolution.

### gmx_mpi saxs:

gmx_mpi: Invokes the GROMACS binary compiled for use with MPI (Message Passing Interface), which enables parallel computation on multi-core systems.
saxs: Specifies the tool within GROMACS to calculate SAXS intensities from the atomic coordinates provided in the trajectory.
### -s npt3.tpr:

Provides the input run parameter file (.tpr), which contains essential simulation data such as the system's topology, box dimensions, and parameters.
This file must be consistent with the trajectory (npt3.trr) being analyzed.
### -f npt3.trr:

Specifies the trajectory file (.trr) containing atomic coordinates and velocities generated during the simulation.
SAXS profiles are calculated based on the frames in this file.
### -b 0:

Indicates the starting time (in picoseconds) for the trajectory analysis. Here, analysis begins at the very first frame (0 ps).
### -e 50000:

Indicates the ending time (in picoseconds) for the trajectory analysis. Here, the analysis stops at 50000 ps.
### -dt 2500:

Specifies the time interval (in picoseconds) between frames that are sampled for SAXS calculation.
In this case, every 2500 ps frame in the trajectory will be used for analysis, skipping intermediate frames.
